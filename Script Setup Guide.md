# Script Setup Guide

# Advisory:

Kindly be informed that the initial execution of the script on your Termux may necessitate a certain duration. This is due to the requirement for the script to perform package updates and upgrades as part of the initial setup process. Additionally, the installation of Python 3 is necessary, as it is a prerequisite for running the main BootSigner script.

*************************************************

**Requirements:**

â€¢ Ensure an active internet connection is available for the initial setup to update and upgrade packages.
